# password-generator-and-vault

This website generates password with different characters like numbers, special charaters and alphabets according to user needs.
The default length of the password is 8, user can genereate from 4 to 12 characters as password. And it stores the generated password in the vault. The user can either generate password with single characters or mixture of characters.

I have used Html, CSS, Bootstrap for frontend to be responsive and python for backend.
